# Family Plates!

This is a place to share and remember insights and ideas from family members about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The current goal is to make it so that annotations can really easily be added to Book of Mormon verses.

Here are some of the ideas for that, thank you Kayla!

## Ideas for easy Annotation creation:

1. Search for chapter and verse to add it to on the home page
2. Search by text and have that pull in the chapter and verse to make an annotation
3. Super simple and intuitive adding when reading the Book of Mormon
4. Adding annotations not tied directly to a scripture

## Other objectives

1. Search annotations by fuzzy match in the text
2. Search by family member
3. Search by scripture

## Infrastructure objectives

1. Real time collaboration
2. Real time updates

## Update as of Jan 21, 2025

Real time updating happens on the feed and when reading thanks to the websocket that is powered with code in [this repo](https://github.com/lgvw3/familyPlatesWebSocketServer) have some things to fix but making progress!
